When shortening an Internet Protocol (IP) v6 address, which two rules are used? Check all that apply.

->Removing all leading zeros.
Correct
Nice job! When shortening an IPv6 address, you can remove any leading zeros from a group.

Replace groups of ones with semicolons.

->Replace groups of zeros with colons.
Correct
Woohoo! Any number of consecutive groups composed of just zeroes can be replaced with two colons.

Removing all leading ones.



Which two tools function similar to traceroute? Check all that apply.

->mtr
Correct
Right on! The mtr command works in real time and will continually update its output with all of the current aggregate data.

->pathping
Correct
Pathping runs for 50 seconds and then displays the final aggregate data all at once.

nslookup

netcat




You run the Test-NetConnection command on a Windows PC while only providing a host name. As a result, what default action does the command use?

->Echo request
Correct
Great work! When running the Test-NetConnection command on a Windows PC and only providing a host name, an Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) echo request (ping) is used.

Private tunnel

Name server lookup

Network address translation




A company runs sensitive technologies locally, while entrusting less-sensitive technologies to a broader user base. Which cloud delivery model is being used?

Public

->Hybrid
Correct
Great work! A combination of cloud delivery models make up a hybrid type of deployment. In this case, both private and public models are being used.

Private

Community




When registering a new domain name, either the registrar's servers or self-owned servers can be used as name servers. What function will the name servers provide for the domain?

Address reservation

->Authoritative
Correct
Nice job! An authoritative name server is responsible for a Domain Name System (DNS) zone.

Error recovery

Domain transfer




When using the netcat command to test a network port, which option will provide output that is not useful for scripting, but is useful for the human eye?

No option is required

-> -v
Correct
Awesome! The “-v” flag, which stands for verbose, is useful as it formats the command’s output to be readable to human eyes.

-z

-Port




How many zeros are found at the beginning of an Internet Protocol (IP) v6 address that correlate to a v4 address?

32

128

40

->80




As an IT decision maker, you plan to satisfy business needs by using software as a service. Which option do you deploy?

Virtual firewall

Linux workstation

Windows Server 2019

->Office 365
Correct
You nailed it! Software as a Service (SaaS) is a model that uses cloud-based software, rather than locally installed software.





What is the name of the provision of services based around hardware virtualization?

Subnetting

Domain Name System (DNS) service model

Network Address Translation (NAT)

->Cloud computing
Correct
Great work! Hardware virtualization is a core concept of how cloud computing technologies work.





Most public Domain Name Servers (DNS) are available globally through which technology?

Hosts file

Echo request

->Anycast
Correct
Awesome! Anycast is a method that pools servers to provide services as if it were a single system.

Time To Live (TTL) field





A Cyclical Redundancy Check (CRC) is an example of what type of built-in protocol mechanism? Check all that apply.

Time To Live (TTL) expiration

Misconfiguration error

->Error recovery
Correct
Right on! If a CRC value doesn't match, it is discarded. The transport layer will decide if the data needs to be resent.

->Error detection
Correct
You got it! If a CRC value doesn't match, it is discarded. The transport layer will decide if the data needs to be resent.





The IPV4 mapped address space within IPv6 always starts with _______ zeroes.

32

64

->80
Correct
Right on! 80 zeroes, followed by 16 ones, followed by the IPv4 address itself it how the IPv4 mapped address space works.

128





Following rules of compaction, the IPv6 address 2001:0db8:0000:0000:0000:ff00:0012:3456 could also be written as _______.

21:db8::ff:12:3456

->2001:db8::ff00:12:3456
Correct
Awesome! IPv6 address compaction is a great way to shorten IPv6 addresses.

::1

0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0001





An organization responsible for assigning individual domain names to other organizations or individuals is known as a(n) ______.

->DNS registrar
Correct
Wohoo! You can use a registrar to register a domain name!

internet authority

autonomous system

government





While in an interactive nslookup session, you'd use the ______ keyword to change the DNS server you're using.

->server
Correct
Nice job! Issuing a server keyword, followed by a DNS server, will change what server you're using for resolution attempts.

client

FQDN

DNS





ICMP stands for ________.

->Internet Control Message Protocol
Correct
Correct! ICMP is used to deliver messages about network errors.

Internet Client Message Protocol

Interactive Control Message Protocol

Internet Control Mail Protocol
