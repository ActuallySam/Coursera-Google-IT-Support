A technique thatâ€™s used to route traffic to different destinations, depending on factors like location, congestion, or link health, is known as _____.

unicast

->anycast
Correct
You got it! Anycast lets you route traffic depending on many factors.

multicast

broadcast




TLD stands for ________

Tidal Locked Destination

Type Level Domain

->Top Level Domain
Correct
Great work! A TLD is the last part of an FQDN.

Typical Looking Domain




Along with an IP address, a subnet mask, and a name server, the other thing required for a computer to operate on a network is a _______.

proxy

->gateway
Correct
Awesome! Every networked device needs a gateway to know where to send network intended for outside of the local network segment.

NTP server

FQDN




The final step of the DHCP Discovery process is known as ______.

->DHCPACK
Correct
That's right! A DHCPACK is the final step in the DHCP Discovery process.

DHCPOFFER

DHCPDISCOVER

DHCPREQUEST




A service that might appear to be a single server to external clients, but actually represents many servers living behind it, is known as a _______.

VPN

multiplexer

->reverse proxy
Correct
Great job! A reverse proxy allows for a single server to appear to be the endpoint for many servers behind it.

proxy




At the very lowest level, what data does a computer understand?

IP (Internet Protocol) addresses

Media Access Control (MAC) addresses

Hexadecimal digits

->Binary numbers
Correct
Right on! Binary numbers are zeros and ones. Fortunately, computers present data in a much friendlier way.




A video conferencing application isn't working due to a Domain Name System (DNS) port error. Which record requires modification to fix the issue?

Canonical name (CNAME)

->Service record (SRV)
Correct
Great work! A service record is used to set parameters, like the protocol and ports used for a service with a domain name.

Host (A)

Text (TXT)




An IT systems engineer creates a new Domain Name System (DNS) zone that contains pointer (PTR) resource records. Which zone type has been created?

->Reverse lookup

Subdomain

Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN)

Start of Authority (SOA)
Correct
Well done! A reverse lookup zone is used to map domain names to IP addresses.




Which technique is used with Network Address Translation (NAT) where a source port chosen by a client is the same port used by a router?

Forwarding

Translation

->Preservation
Correct
Well done! Preservation helps a router determine which traffic belongs to which host when using NAT.

Masquerading




Which technology uses a tunneling protocol?

Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)

Domain Name System (DNS)

Network Address Translation (NAT)

->Virtual Private Network (VPN)
Correct
You got it! A VPN uses a tunnel to maintain private and secure communications.





During the name resolution process, which server does a local recursive server contact first?

Top level domain (TLD) server

->Root name server
Correct
You got it! A root name server is queried first in DNS resolution and seeks out TLD servers for information.

Caching name server

Authoritative name server




A new Domain Name System (DNS) server is being configured. Which record type is used to declare a new zone?

Mail Exchanger (MX)

->Start of Authority (SOA)
Correct
Great work! An SOA record establishes a zone and maintains authority over the zone.

Pointer (PTR)

Name server (NS)




What term defines keeping the address of one computer secret from another?

Translation

Rewriting

->Masquerading
Correct
Right on! Masquerading is when NAT is used to hide the IP of a computer from another.

Preservation




An internal system behind a firewall needs to be configured for remote access. How should Network Address Translation be configured?

One-to-many NAT

->Port forwarding
Correct
Nice job! Forwarding external traffic to the system by using port forwarding maintains internal address secrecy.

Preservation

Rewriting




What service acts on behalf of a client in order to access another service?

->Proxy Server
Correct
Nice job! Proxies sit between clients and other servers to facilitate connections.

Domain Name System (DNS)

Virtual Private Network (VPN) Tunnel

Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)




When a client computer sends a request to a Domain Name System (DNS) server, what type of packet is sent?

SYN/ACK

TCP

ACK

->SYN
Correct
Awesome! The requesting client initiates a query with a DNS server by sending a Synchronize (SYN) packet as a first step in the three-way handshake.
