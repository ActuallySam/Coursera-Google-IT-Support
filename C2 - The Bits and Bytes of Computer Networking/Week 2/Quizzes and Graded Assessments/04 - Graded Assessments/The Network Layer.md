ARP stands for ______.

Anonymous Resource Protocol

Augmented Resolution Picture

->Address Resolution Protocol
Correct
Nice job! ARP is used to discover what MAC address is associated with a specific IP address.

Aggressive Resource Protection



A network device that knows how to forward data along to other networks is known as a ______.

switch

hub

->router
Correct
Right on! A router allows devices on different networks to communicate with each other.

server



RFC stands for ______.

Routing Frequency Control

->Request For Comments
Correct
That's right! RFCs have long been used to help establish agreed-upon standards and protocols.

Realtime Frame Check

Redundant Frame Controller



A ________ is where one network ends and another begins.

subnet mask

routing table

->demarcation point
Correct
You got it! It's important to know about demarcation points so that you understand where responsibility of the operation of a network begins and ends.

routing protocol




Using CIDR notation, the subnet mask 255.255.255.0 would be written as _______.

/64

->/24
Correct
Wohoo! 255.255.255.0 is one of the more common subnet masks.

/8

/16



Calculate how many decimal numbers a 4-bit number can represent.

8

4

->16
Correct
Right on! A bit is base two.  The calculation of a 4-bit number is 2^4 = 16.

256



What information will you find in the 16-bit field in an IP datagram?

->The total length of the datagram it's attached to
Correct

The quality of service technologies

The Internet Protocol version

The header length field




What is eight bits of data called?

Figure eight

Octuplet

Octoploid

->Octet
Correct
You nailed it! Eight bits of data, or a single octet, can represent all decimal numbers from 0-255.



Which is a valid IP address?

598.36.789

126.396.659.100

->128.42.64.78
Correct
You got it! 128.42.64.78 has the correct notation and does not containany numbers that can't be represented by a single octet.

A8:97:4F:6D:H6:0F



Which IP address is Class C?

->192.37.48.98
Correct
Well done! Class C addresses begin with a first octet value of 192 through 223.

128.42.39.72

132.26.144.52

224.24.45.69



What protocol is used to discover the hardware address of a node with a certain IP address?

Subnet mask

->ARP table
Correct
You got it! An ARP table is just a list of IP addresses and the MAC addresses associated with them.

SQL database

CIDR, or Classless Inter-Domain Routing



What does the subnet mask 255.255.255.0 tell a router?

->Which part of an IP address is the subnet ID and which is the host ID
Correct
You nailed it! The purpose of the part of the mask that reads 255, or all 1s in binary, is to tell a router what part of an IP address is the subnet ID.

The static IP of the gateway router

The next hop in the network route

What the MAC address of a host is




What is the maximum decimal number possible to represent with 16 bits?

1600

->65536
Correct
Woohoo! If you have a 16-bit number, you can just perform the math 2^16 which would be 65536 numbers.

16

256




Computer A wants to send some data to computer B. Computer A knows that Computer B is not on its local network, so it sends the packet to the router between Network A and Network B. Based on how many network hops have happened, how much will the TTL field be decremented by?

1

6

8

->2
Correct
Awesome! The router decrements the TTL field by one for each network hop and calculates a new header checksum.



What type of network address space allows for nodes on a network to communicate with each other, but prevents any gateway router from forwarding traffic there, and are reserved for internal networks?

IP address

Subnet mask

MAC address

->Non-routable address space
Correct
Right on! Non-routable address space allows for nodes on such a network to communicate with each other, but no gateway router will attempt to forward traffic to this type of network.
