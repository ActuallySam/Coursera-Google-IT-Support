Question 1
Plaintext is the original message, while _____ is the encrypted message.

1 / 1 point

Ciphertext


Cipher


Digest


Algorithm

Correct
Yep! Once the original message is encrypted, the result is referred to as ciphertext.

2.
Question 2
The specific function of converting plaintext into ciphertext is called a(n) ______.

1 / 1 point

Permutation


Integrity check


Encryption algorithm


Data protection standard

Correct
Nice job! An encryption algorithm is the specific function or steps taken to convert plaintext into encrypted ciphertext.

3.
Question 3
Studying how often letters and pairs of letters occur in a language is referred to as _______.

1 / 1 point

Frequency analysis


Espionage


Cryptography


Codebreaking

Correct
Great work! Frequency analysis involves studying how often letters occur, and looking for similarities in ciphertext to uncover possible plaintext mappings.

4.
Question 4
True or false: The same plaintext encrypted using the same algorithm and same encryption key would result in different ciphertext outputs.

1 / 1 point

TRUE


FALSE

Correct
Wohoo! If the plaintext, algorithm, and key are all the same, the resulting ciphertext would also be the same.

5.
Question 5
The practice of hiding messages instead of encoding them is referred to as ______.

1 / 1 point

Steganography


Hashing


Obfuscation


Encryption

Correct
That's right! Steganography involves hiding messages from discovery instead of encoding them.

6.
Question 6
ROT13 and a Caesar cipher are examples of _______.

1 / 1 point

Substitution ciphers


Steganography


Asymmetric encryption


Digital signatures

Correct
Awesome! These are both examples of substitution ciphers, since they substitute letters for other letters in the alphabet.

7.
Question 7
DES, RC4, and AES are examples of ______ encryption algorithms.

1 / 1 point

Symmetric


Weak


Asymmetric


Strong

Correct
Exactly! DES, RC4, and AES are all symmetric encryption algorithms.

8.
Question 8
What are the two components of an asymmetric encryption system, necessary for encryption and decryption operations? Check all that apply.

1 / 1 point

Random number generator


Digest


Public key

Correct
You got it! In asymmetric encryption systems, there's a private key used for encryption, and a public key used for decryption.


Private key

Correct
You got it! In asymmetric encryption systems, there's a private key used for encryption, and a public key used for decryption.

9.
Question 9
To create a public key signature, you would use the ______ key.

1 / 1 point

Symmetric


Public


Decryption


Private

Correct
Nice work! The private key is used to sign data. This allows a third party to verify the signature using the public key, ensuring that the signature came from someone in possession of the private key.

10.
Question 10
Using an asymmetric cryptosystem provides which of the following benefits? Check all that apply.

1 / 1 point

Non-repudiation

Correct
That's exactly right! Confidentiality is provided by the encryption, authenticity is achieved through the use of digital signatures, and non-repudiation is also provided by digitally signing data.


Hashing


Authenticity

Correct
That's exactly right! Confidentiality is provided by the encryption, authenticity is achieved through the use of digital signatures, and non-repudiation is also provided by digitally signing data.


Confidentiality

Correct
That's exactly right! Confidentiality is provided by the encryption, authenticity is achieved through the use of digital signatures, and non-repudiation is also provided by digitally signing data.

11.
Question 11
If two different files result in the same hash, this is referred to as a ________.

1 / 1 point

Hash collision


Coincidence


Key collision


Mistake

Correct
Correct! A hash collision is when two different inputs yield the same hash.

12.
Question 12
When authenticating a user's password, the password supplied by the user is authenticated by comparing the ____ of the password with the one stored on the system.

1 / 1 point

Hash


Plaintext


Ciphertext


Length

Correct
Yep! Passwords are verified by hashing and comparing hashes. This is to avoid storing plaintext passwords.

13.
Question 13
If a rainbow table is used instead of brute-forcing hashes, what is the resource trade-off?

1 / 1 point

Rainbow tables use less storage space and more RAM resources


Rainbow tables use less RAM resources and more computational resources


Rainbow tables use less computational resources and more storage space 


Rainbow tables use less storage space and more computational resources 

Correct
Wohoo! Instead of computing every hash, a rainbow table is a precomputed table of hashes and text. Using a rainbow table to lookup a hash requires a lot less computing power, but a lot more storage space.

14.
Question 14
In a PKI system, what entity is responsible for issuing, storing, and signing certificates?

1 / 1 point

Registration Authority


Intermediary Authority


Government


Certificate Authority

Correct
Excellent job! The certificate authority is the entity that signs, issues, and stores certificates.
