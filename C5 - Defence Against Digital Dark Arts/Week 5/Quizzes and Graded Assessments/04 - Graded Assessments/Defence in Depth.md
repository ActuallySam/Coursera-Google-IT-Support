What does a host-based firewall protect against that a network-based one doesn't? Check all that apply.

Protection from XSS attacks

Protection from MITM attacks

Protection in untrusted networks
Correct
Nice work! A host-based firewall can provide protection to systems that are mobile and may operate in untrusted networks. It can also provide protection from compromised peers on the same network.


Protection from compromised peers
Correct
Nice work! A host-based firewall can provide protection to systems that are mobile and may operate in untrusted networks. It can also provide protection from compromised peers on the same network.




What does full-disk encryption protect against? Check all that apply.

Malware

Eavesdropping

Data tampering
Correct
Wohoo! Encrypting the entire disk prevents unauthorized access to the data in case it's lost or stolen. It also protects against malicious tampering of the files contained on the disk.


Data theft
Correct
Wohoo! Encrypting the entire disk prevents unauthorized access to the data in case it's lost or stolen. It also protects against malicious tampering of the files contained on the disk.




What is a class of vulnerabilities that are unknown before they are exploited?

Attack Vectors

Attack Surfaces

ACLs

->0-days
Nice job! 0-day vulnerabilities are unique in that they are previously unknown before being exploited in the wild.



If a userâ€™s machine gets infected with malware within a trusted network, what can help protect computers inside the trusted network from the compromised one?

Active Directory

->A host-based firewall
Great work! Host-based firewalls are important for protecting individual hosts from being compromised when they are used in untrusted, potentially malicious environments, as well as protecting them from potentially compromised peers inside a trusted network.

The Domain Controller

A network-based firewall



Which of these plays an important role in keeping attack traffic off your systems and helps to protect users? Check all that apply.

Full disk encryption (FDE)

Antivirus software
Correct
Woohoo! Antivirus software will monitor and analyze things, like new files being created or files being modified on the system, for any behavior that matches a known malware signature.


Multiple Attack Vectors

Antimalware measures
Correct
Woohoo! There is a huge amount of attack traffic on the internet, and antimalware measures play an important role in keeping this type of attack off your systems and helping to protect your users.




Which of these protects against the most common attacks on the internet via a database of signatures, but at the same time actually represents an additional attack surface that attackers can exploit to compromise systems?

Binary whitelisting software

->Antivirus software
Great work! Antivirus, which is designed to protect systems, actually represents an additional attack surface that attackers can exploit to compromise systems.


Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system

Full disk encryption (FDE)




What is the purpose of installing updates on your computer? Check all that apply.

Updating helps block all unwanted traffic.

Updating adds new features.
Correct
Awesome! Software updates improve software products by adding new features.


Updating addresses security vulnerabilities.
Correct
Awesome! Software updates improve software products by addressing security vulnerabilities.


Updating improves performance and stability.
Correct
Awesome! Software updates improve software products by improving performance and stability.




Why is it risky if you wanted to make an exception to the application policy to allow file sharing software?

->The software could be infected with malware.
Correct
Nice job! It is generally a good idea to have a policy to disallow particularly risky classes of software. Things like file sharing software and piracy-related software tend to be closely associated with malware infections.

The software can shrink attack vectors.

The software could disable full disk encryption (FDE).

The software can normalize log data.
